# Pathfinding

Welcome to this Path Finding visualization (and also, my first GitHub project ðŸ˜œ )! 
You can have fun with this project at https://giacomoporpiglia.github.io/VisualPathFinding/ (Use Chrome!!!)
At the moment you can try 3 different Algorithms: 
## Dijkstra
Dijkstra is the father of all pathfining algorithms, and it always gives the BEST path from a starting node to the end.

## A*
 A* is a path-finding algorithm which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. It uses a conept called "heuristic" (which yuo can play with on the demo) to choose what node to evaluate next, based on its chance of being the right one for the optimal path.
 
 ## Breadth-first search
 Breadth-first search (BFS) starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It is guaranteed that BFS always finds, if existing, the best path from point A to B in a graph.
 
 ## Best-first search
Best-first search is an algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node. Therefore, since not every node is explored, it's never guaranteed that this algorithm finds the best possible path between point A and B, since it picks the next choice and immediately expands it to keep going forward, without making sure that that choice actually was the best of all.
