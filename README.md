# Pathfinding

Welcome to this Path Finding visualization (and also, my first GitHub project :) )! 
You can have fun with this project at https://giacomoporpiglia.github.io/VisualPathFinding/ (Use Chrome!!!)
At the moment you can try 3 different Algorithms: 
## Dijkstra
Dijkstra is the father of all pathfining algorithms, and it always gives the BEST path from a starting node to the end. Its time complexity is O(Nâ‹…log(N))
