# Pathfinding

Welcome to this Path Finding visualization (and also, my first GitHub project :) )! 
You can have fun with this project at https://giacomoporpiglia.github.io/VisualPathFinding/ (Use Chrome!!!)
At the moment you can try 3 different Algorithms: 
## Dijkstra
Dijkstra is the father of all pathfining algorithms, and it always gives the BEST path from a starting node to the end.

## A*
 A* is a path-finding algorithm which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. It uses a conept called "heuristic" (which yuo can play with on the demo) to choose what node to evaluate next, based on its chance of being the right one for the optimal path.
 
 ## Breadth-first search
 
 ## Best-first search
